[Download Windows executable (PyInstaller)](https://github.com/JasonSpine/WordFinder/releases/download/v1.0/WordFinder.zip)  
  
Windows Defender doesn't like this executable, because of "Unknown publisher"...  
If that's the case, please click ``More info`` and ``Run anyway`` button.  
You may also run this app directly from Python script if you don't trust this executable...  
Anyway, rest assured, this executable and app code is not harmful for your PC...    

Tested with this dictionary: https://sjp.pl/sl/growy/   
**You need to put a dictionary named "dictionary.txt" in the same directory as this app.**
